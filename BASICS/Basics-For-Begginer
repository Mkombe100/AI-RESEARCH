BASIC CONCEPTS IN PYTHON
1. Core Python Fundamentals
These are the building blocks for any Python-based AI project:

Variables and Data Types: Understand integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. AI libraries like Pandas and NumPy rely heavily on lists and dictionaries for data handling.
Control Flow: Master if, elif, else statements, for and while loops, and list comprehensions for efficient data processing (e.g., filtering data in Pandas).
Functions: Learn to define functions with def, use parameters, return values, and handle lambda functions. Functions are crucial for modular code in ML pipelines.
Modules and Packages: Know how to import libraries (e.g., import numpy as np, import pandas as pd) and manage dependencies using pip or conda.
Error Handling: Use try, except, and finally to handle errors gracefully, especially when working with large datasets or training models.

2. Working with Data Structures
AI workflows depend on efficient data manipulation:

Lists and List Comprehensions: Essential for preprocessing data before feeding it into NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames.

Example: [x**2 for x in range(10)] for quick transformations.


Dictionaries: Key for storing key-value pairs, used in model configuration (e.g., hyperparameters in Scikit-learn or Keras).
NumPy Arrays: Understand NumPy’s ndarray for fast numerical operations, as it’s the backbone of most AI libraries.

Example: np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) for matrix operations.


Pandas DataFrames: Master DataFrame creation, indexing, filtering, and merging for data preprocessing.

Example: df['column'].apply(lambda x: x*2) for column transformations.



3. File I/O and Data Handling
AI tasks often involve reading and writing data:

Reading/Writing Files: Use open() for text/CSV files, and libraries like pandas.read_csv() for datasets.
JSON and CSV Handling: Parse JSON with json module and CSV with Pandas for real-world datasets.
Working with Large Datasets: Learn to handle memory-efficient data loading (e.g., pandas.read_csv(chunksize=1000)).

4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is useful for structuring complex AI projects:

Classes and Objects: Understand how to define classes, methods, and attributes. Many libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) use class-based APIs for models.

Example: Defining a custom PyTorch model with class MyModel(nn.Module).


Inheritance: Useful for extending models in Keras or PyTorch (e.g., subclassing tf.keras.Model).
Encapsulation: Organize code for reusability in ML pipelines.
5. Key Python Libraries for AI
Familiarity with the libraries you listed is critical. Here’s what to focus on:

NumPy: Array creation, indexing, slicing, and operations like np.dot(), np.reshape(). Essential for tensor operations and data preprocessing.
Pandas: DataFrame manipulation (groupby, merge, pivot_table), handling missing data (fillna, dropna), and filtering.
